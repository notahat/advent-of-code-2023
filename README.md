# Advent of Code 2023

## Day 1: Trebuchet?!

Quickly hacked up in Ruby, just to get my eye in.

## Day 2: Cube Conundrum

Still Ruby, a little more rigorous, with a Rakefile to run everything.

## Day 3: Gear Ratios

This one was harder than I thought!

In particular, the second part was a big departure from the first. In part one,
I looked for numbers, and then checked for adjacent symbols. But, in part two,
I had to look for symbols and then find adjacent numbers. I'm not sure there
was any way around this.

I thought I'd try this one in Typescript, and then spent ages trying to
convince tsx, jest, prettier, and eslin to all play nicely. I think I'll go
back to Ruby for the next one.

## Day 4: Scratchcards

This one was easier.

I thought I'd try out sorbet with Ruby this time. Wasn't really worth it. I
spent a bunch of time arguing with sorbet, and didn't win. For this sort of
problem where we're only dealing with well-formed input, strict types don't
help that much.
